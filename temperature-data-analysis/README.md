### temperature-data-analysis

This project is inspired by 'Data Visualization' Course on Coursera offered by University of Michigan.

    1. Visualization shows line graph of record high and record low temperatures by day of the year from 2005-2014.

    2. Also, overlays a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record 
       high or record low was broken in 2015.
